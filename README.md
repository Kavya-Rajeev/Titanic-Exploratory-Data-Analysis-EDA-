# Titanic-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-(EDA)
 ## Objective: Extract insights from Titanic dataset using visual and statistical exploration.
 
 ## Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Summary of findings:
- Gender: Females had significantly higher survival rates compared to males, reflecting the "women and children first" policy.
- Class (Pclass): Passengers in 1st class had the highest survival rate, while 3rd class had the lowestâ€”highlighting a clear socioeconomic impact.
- Age: Although age had a weak overall correlation with survival, younger passengers (especially children) had slightly better chances of survival.
- Fare: Higher fare-paying passengers were more likely to survive. This is consistent with the correlation between fare and Pclass.
- Correlation Matrix: Showed a moderate positive correlation between survival and fare, and a negative correlation between survival and Pclass.
- Pairplots and Scatterplots: Helped visualize how age, fare, and Pclass interact with survival status, showing clear clusters among survivors.
